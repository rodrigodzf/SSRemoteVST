  /**
   * Currently there is nothing put in this method.
   *
   * JUCE Doc.:
   *
   * Renders the next block.
   *
   * When this method is called, the buffer contains a number of channels which
   * is at least as great as the maximum number of input and output channels
   * that this filter is using. It will be filled with the filter's input data
   * and should be replaced with the filter's output.
   *
   * So for example if your filter has 2 input channels and 4 output channels,
   * then the buffer will contain 4 channels, the first two being filled with
   * the input data. Your filter should read these, do its processing, and
   * replace the contents of all 4 channels with its output.
   *
   * Or if your filter has 5 inputs and 2 outputs, the buffer will have 5
   * channels, all filled with data, and your filter should overwrite the first
   * 2 of these with its output. But be VERY careful not to write anything to
   * the last 3 channels, as these might be mapped to memory that the host
   * assumes is read-only!
   *
   * Note that if you have more outputs than inputs, then only those channels
   * that correspond to an input channel are guaranteed to contain sensible
   * data - e.g. in the case of 2 inputs and 4 outputs, the first two channels
   * contain the input, but the last two channels may contain garbage, so you
   * should be careful not to let this pass through without being overwritten
   * or cleared.
   *
   * Also note that the buffer may have more channels than are strictly
   * necessary, but you should only read/write from the ones that your filter
   * is supposed to be using.
   *
   * The number of samples in these buffers is NOT guaranteed to be the same
   * for every callback, and may be more or less than the estimated value given
   * to prepareToPlay(). Your code must be able to cope with variable-sized
   * blocks, or you're going to get clicks and crashes!
   *
   * If the filter is receiving a midi input, then the midiMessages array will
   * be filled with the midi messages for this block. Each message's timestamp
   * will indicate the message's time, as a number of samples from the start of
   * the block.
   *
   * Any messages left in the midi buffer when this method has finished are
   * assumed to be the filter's midi output. This means that your filter should
   * be careful to clear any incoming messages from the array if it doesn't
   * want them to be passed-on.
   *
   * Be very careful about what you do in this callback - it's going to be
   * called by the audio thread, so any kind of interaction with the UI is
   * absolutely out of the question. If you change a parameter in here and need
   * to tell your UI to update itself, the best way is probably to inherit from
   * a ChangeBroadcaster, let the UI components register as listeners, and then
   * call sendChangeMessage() inside the processBlock() method to send out an
   * asynchronous message. You could also use the AsyncUpdater class in a
   * similar way.

   * This can return nullptr if you want a UI-less filter, in which case the

   * directly.
   *
   * If you do want to pass back a component, the component should be created

   * method, you must also implement the hasEditor() method and make it return
   * true.

   * pointer to the component that gets created - it could be deleted later
   * without any warning, which would make your pointer into a dangler. Use the
   * getActiveEditor() method instead.
   *
   * The correct way to handle the connection between an editor component and
   * its filter is to use something like a ChangeBroadcaster so that the editor
   * can register itself as a listener, and be told when a change occurs. This
   * lets them safely unregister themselves when they are deleted.
   *
   * Here are a few things to bear in mind when writing an editor:
   *
   * Initially there won't be an editor, until the user opens one, or they
   * might not open one at all. Your filter mustn't rely on it being there.
   * An editor object may be deleted and a replacement one created again at any
   * time. It's safe to assume that an editor will be deleted before its filter.
