/**
* This class represents the graphical user interface (GUI) of the VST-Plugin.
* The GUI is splitted in a 'Head' and 'Source' part.
*
* The 'Head' part includes the 'Network Component' and the 'New Source' Button.
*
* The 'Source' part includes the source selection GUI element, all the source
* properties (Name, Jackport, Model, Properties File, Azimuth, Mute, Fixed and
* Gain) and also a pad representing the sources spatial position.
