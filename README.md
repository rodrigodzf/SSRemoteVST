# Introduction

This VST Plugin addresses the need for the automation of [SoundScapeRenderer (SSR)](http://spatialaudio.net/ssr/) scenes from a [Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation).

The SSRemote VST plugin was developed for Linux and tested with the [Ardour DAW](http://ardour.org/). Since the Plugin was developed in the light of cross-platform compatibility it also can run under other Operating Systems (OS) such as OSX and other DAWs (Reaper, Ableton and Logic).

Since this is a <b>experimental open source project</b>, any contributions are very much welcome!

# Installation

Please read the [installation guide](https://github.com/rodrigodzf/SSRemoteVST/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md).

# Configuration

## Environment Variables

Please set the environment variables as follows, since the following environment variables are not only needed for compilation but also at runtime:

  The directory/location of the Steinberg VST3 SDK:

  ```bash
  # Steinberg VST3 Audio Plug-Ins SDK
  export VST3_SDK=/path/to/VST3SDK
  ```

  The directory/location of the SSRemote VST:

  ```bash
  # SSRemote VST
  export SSREMOTE_VST=/path/to/ssremote_vst
  ```

  The directory/location of the JUCE Framework located in the SSRemote VST:

  ```bash
  # SSRemote VST JUCE Framework
  export JUCE_LIB_CODE=$SSREMOTE_VST/JUCE
  ```

## XML Configuration File

The VST Plugin requires a config file to successfully establish a TCP/IP connection to the SSR. The user has to create a file called <b>ssremote_config.xml</b> with the following content:

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<config>
  <network>
    <host>localhost</host>
    <port>4711</port>
    <timeout>1000</timeout>
  </network>
</config>
```

| Markup | Description |
| ------:|:------------|
|network|the network configuration|
|host   |the host on which the SSR is running|
|port   |the port on which the SSR is listening for incoming TCP/IP requests|
|timeout|the time in milliseconds the VST Plugin waits for an answer by the SSR|

The contents of the markups host, port and timeout are just examples which the user may edit regarding his systems and SSR configuration.

# General Information

## Running the VST Plugin

To remotly control the SSR scene from the Plugin the user has to do the following:

1. Start the JACK Audio Connection Kit
2. Start the SSR and load a scene
3. Start the DAW and load the SSRemote VST Plugin

## Automatable Parameters

The Host (DAW) is able to automate the following parameters:

+ X Position
+ Y Position
+ Gain
+ Mute
+ Model
+ Fixed

## Logfiles

The Plug-In logs will be written to the file ```log.txt```, located in the root directory.<br/>
The logs will look as follows:
