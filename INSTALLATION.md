# Installation / Compilation

The following is a installation guide written for Linux Distributions. The system that was used for testing the guide is [Fedora 22](https://start.fedoraproject.org/). It may help you compiling the SSRemote VST but in no case asserts to claim completness.

The Plugin uses the [C++11 Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11) which has to be supported by your compiler (e.g. at least GCC 4.7).

OSX NOTE: As of December 2015 there's no full support for jack in 10.11.x, although there's is a beta version that works with some bugs (https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2/issues/144).

1. Clone the VST Plugin repository from Github:

  ```shell
  # HTTPS
  git clone https://github.com/QULab/SSRemoteVST.git
